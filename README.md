# Fixing Matlab Vector Graphics Output
Clean/Repair .eps PostScript vector graphic files created by Matlab R2016b and Matlab R2017a. (Not working with R2017b and later versions ([yet](https://github.com/Conclusio/matlab-epsclean/issues/10))).
* Paths are grouped together according to their properties
* White line artifacts are fixed
* Broken up polylines are connected back together if they share the same properties (good for post-processing in Illustrator/Inkscape/etc.)
* Adjacent polygons of the same type are merged together (use parameter 'combineAreas')

## Example

Here is an example of what the .eps file looks before and after fixing it:

```
%%% Matlab Code
z = peaks;
contourf(z);
print(gcf,'-depsc','-painters','out.eps');
epsclean('out.eps'); % cleans and overwrites the input file
```

**Layer count in Adobe Illustrator: 789 (before) vs. 30 (after)**

## Another Example

```
%%% Matlab Code
[X,Y,Z] = peaks(100);
[~,ch] = contourf(X,Y,Z);
ch.LineStyle = 'none';
ch.LevelStep = ch.LevelStep/10;
colormap('hot')
saveas(gcf, 'out.eps', 'epsc');
epsclean('out.eps'); % cleans and overwrites the input file
```

**Layer count in Adobe Illustrator: 11,775 (before) vs. 76 (after)**

## Notes

* If you experience Z-order problems (i.e. the overlappings of your graphics change) try using parameter 'groupSoft' = true.
```
%%% Matlab Code
epsclean('out.eps','groupSoft',true);
```

* If you have separating lines between filled areas ([example - gaps highlighted in yellow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38227689/38556022-18bfe056-3cc0-11e8-89e6-ad3984276b20.png)) try using parameter 'closeGaps' = true.
```
%%% Matlab Code
epsclean('out.eps','closeGaps',true);
```

* Have a look at the tests/cleantest.m script for test cases and examples
* Report any problems here at github with your examples (code or .eps file). I try my best to fix them
